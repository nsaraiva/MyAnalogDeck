# MyAnalogDeck
Under construction
Hi! This is my attempt at making a deck. I know, there are already a lot of decks out there.
How about one more? ðŸ˜œ
The intention is to make a deck, using an analog keypad. The **4x4 analog out keypad** is pretty cheap. 

The bad thing about this type of keypad is that it's analog and the values generated by pressing a button vary widely.

To solve this problem, I decided to get a sample of the values generated by the button when I keep it pressed, and stick with the one that appears the most in the sample.
I think it got much better.

Another problem is that this keypad does not have a screen where it can dynamically display commands or shortcut icons.

I thought of leaving the last button on the keypad as if it were a menu button. When pressed, it will open an app on the PC, where the buttons and their respective commands and shortcuts are displayed.

To simulate keystrokes, I use the [InputSimulator Standard](https://github.com/GregsStack/InputSimulatorStandard/) package, which can be installed from Nuget.
